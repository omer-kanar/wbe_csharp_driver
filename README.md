# wbe_csharp_driver
This is a collection of drivers for the Shenzhen World Bridge Electronics Co., Ltd serial magnetic card readers. 

I have been working with the WBE Card readers for some time now and have decided to open source the driver that I wrote to work with them. Feel free to use it anyway that you see fit the only thing I ask is that if you improve on it please contribute back to the project. And if it helps you and you are feeling generous buy me a beer!

If you need help with intergrating this with your project let me know... I also have java version of these that I will hopefully be posting soon. Check out my blog http://www.musingsofacodefiend.com/
